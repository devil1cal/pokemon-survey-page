  <p>Hi there, I'm self-taught junior front-end designer. 
  This is my own code, I will change and fix many issues in time. 
  I created this one for certification program on <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>. 
  You can see my code on <a href="https://codepen.io/devil1cal/pen/qMVzvx">Code Pen</a> too. 
  I'm still learning important componants about the language, espacially CSS. 
  I tried to make responsive and compatible for cross-browsers, but still I need to check, 
  fix and add some componants like;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I need to change the code for smooth responsive</li>
      <li>I need to add cross-browser componants</li>
     </ul>
   <p>Created by me, on september 8 2018, finished september 11 2018</p>
